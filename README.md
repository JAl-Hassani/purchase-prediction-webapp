# 🛍️ Purchase Prediction Web App

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts whether a customer will make a purchase based on their input data. Built with Python and scikit-learn, this app demonstrates a complete ML pipeline from training to deployment.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Binary Classification**: Predicts purchase likelihood (Yes/No).
- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes a Random Forest classifier saved as `pipeline_rf.joblib`.
- **Simple Interface**: Accepts user input via a simple graphical user interface.
- **Lightweight Deployment**: Runs locally as a streamlit application.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The application loads a pre-trained machine learning pipeline and prompts the user to input relevant features. It then processes the input through the pipeline to decide if a purchase will be made.
